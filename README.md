Dog Shelter React app to practice using routes (React Router v6) as well as using bootstrap with react components.

Build an app that allows a user to browse dogs.

At the top of the app, add a navbar that displays the current active route.

The app should have the following routes:

/dogs is the homepage and shows all three dogs
When youâ€™re on the homepage, you can click on a dog to view more information on that dog. Each dog should have its own unique route. For example, clicking on Whiskey will take you to /dogs/whiskey.
Every other endpoint not listed should redirect you to /dogs.
Make the website responsive (if you have time). The solution uses bootstrap to add a responsive navbar and grid layout.
